\title{The design and construction of the MICE Electron-Muon Ranger}
\author{}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The Electron-Muon Ranger (EMR) is a totally active scintillator detector installed in the beam of the Muon Ionization
Cooling Experiment (MICE) \cite{MICEweb}. The experiment will demonstrate ionization cooling, an essential technology needed
for the realization of a Neutrino Factory and/or Muon Collider. The EMR is aimed at measuring the properties of the low
energy beam composed of muons, electrons and pions, performing the identification particle by particle. The detector is
made of 48 stacked layers alternately measuring the X- and the Y-coordinate. Each layer consists of 59 triangular
scintillator bars. The read-out is based on FPGA custom made electronics and commercially available modules. This article
will describe the construction of the detector, starting with the process of designing the detector up to its final
commissioning with particle beam.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
The Neutrino Factory based on a high-energy muon storage-ring is the ultimate tool to study the neutrino mixing matrix
and is established as the best facility to discover, and study the possible leptonic CP violation. It will produce the
most intense, pure and focused neutrino beam ever achieved and is also the first step towards a $\mu^+ \mu^-$ collider.
The Neutrino Factory accelerator complex will use as a sources muons, produced as a tertiary beam. A proton beam bombarding
a target will produce pions. These pions will be captured and focused in a high-field solenoid channel and will decay
to muons, creating a low energy muon beam with very large emittance.  The emittance of the muons needs to be reduced,
i.e the muon must be “cooled”, so that the beam can be accelerated efficiently.

\begin{figure}[htb]

    2. Heating from multiple scattering
    3. $P_L$ restored by RF cavities    
   }
 \label{icool}     
\end{figure}

Ionization cooling \cite{icool1} (Fig.\ \ref{icool}) provides the only practical solution to this problem,
because it is fast enough to cool the beam within the muon lifetime ($\tau_\mu \sim 2.2 \ \mu s$). The cooling effect is
accomplished by passing the muons through a low-Z materiall (\textquotedblleft absorber\textquotedblright), in which they
loses energy via ionization, reducing both the longitudinal and the transverse components of momentum. Later the longitudinal
momentum is restored by accelerating cavities. The net effect is a reduction of the beam emittance. To maximize cooling
we need the absorber to be placed at a position where the transverse momentum $P_T$
has a maximum (the transverse betatron function $\beta_{\perp}$ has a minimum).

\subsection{MICE}
The international Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE) \cite{MICEweb} is under development at the Rutherford Appleton
Laboratory (UK). The goal of the experiment is to build a section of a cooling channel that can demonstrate the principle
of Ionization cooling and to verify its performance in a muon beam. 

Since energy loss by ionization and multiple Coulomb scattering are momentum dependent, the ionization-cooling effect is
momentum dependent. MICE (Fig. \ref{mice}) uses variety of muon beams of limited intensity, having central momenta in the
range $140 - 240 \ MeV/c$ and a momentum spread of $\sim 20 \ MeV/c$. These muon beams are generated using a titanium target
\cite{target} which is dipped into the ISIS proton beam \cite{isis}. Produced secondary and tertiary particles are captured,
momentum-selected and transported to the cooling section by a system of magnets which includes: $5\ T$ superconducting pion
decay solenoid, two dipole magnets, nine quadrupole magnets and a mechanism for inflation of the initial emittance called Diffuser.

The cooling section of MICE, is similar to the cooling channel for the International Design Study
for the Neutrino Factory \cite{ids-nf}. It consists of one primary lithium-hydride (LiH) absorber, two secondary absorbers,
two focus coils and two 201 MHz RF cavities. The two superconducting focus-coil modules provide strong focusing at the
absorber, ensuring that the transverse betatron function is minimised at this position and enhancing the cooling effect. 
All beam particles are detected individually by two identical Scintillating fiber trackers in 4T
solenoids, situated upstream and downstream of the cooling section. The beam emittance is reconstructed, by measuring the
spatial coordinates and momentum ($x,y,p_x,p_y,p_z$) of each muon.

The particle content of the beam is measured by a dedicated system of detectors situated upstream and downstream of the
cooling section and designed to provide precise muon, pion and electron identification. The upstream part includes two
Time-of-flight hodoscopes (TOF0 and TOF1) and a Cherenkov detectors (Ckov). The downstream part combines another 
Time-of-flight hodoscope (TOF2) and a calorimeter system. The calorimeter system consists of the KLOE-Light (KL)
lead-scintillator sampling calorimeter, similar to the KLOE design [30], but with thinner lead foils, serving
as a preshower for the totally-active Electron-Muon ranger (EMR), situated behind him.

\end{figure}

MICE will measure the normalised transverse emittance $\epsilon_N$ with a precision of 
$\sigma_{\epsilon_N}/\epsilon_N \sim 0.1 \%$ when $6\%$ cooling effect is  expected for a muon beam with a nominal momentum
of $200 \ MeV/c$ and 4D normalised emittance $\epsilon_N = 5.8 \ \pi mm \times rad$ is .

\section{Electron-Muon Ranger (EMR)}
EMR is a fully active scintillator detector. It can be classified as tracking calorimeter, since its granularity allows for track reconstruction.
The primary purpose of the detector is to distinguish muons from their decay products, rejecting events in which the muon decays in-flight along
the cooling section \cite{ruslan}.  This allows for the selection of a muon beam with a contamination below 1\%.
The range of the muon track can be measured, providing an estimate of the momentum of the muon. 

The construction of the detector started in the early 2011 and in October 2013 the detector was fully commissioned with beam
during one month of a dedicated data-taking at RAL. In 2014 the detector was upgraded, including a replacement of the single-anode
photo-multiplier tubes and installation of a new high-voltage system.

\subsection{Design}
The EMR is built of triangular scintillator bars arranged in planes. 
% A drawing of one plane is shown on Figure~\ref{fig:emr_plane}.
One plane contains 59 bars and covers an area of 1.27~m$^2$. Each even bar is rotated by 180 degrees with respect to the odd one.
A cross-section of bars and their arrangement in a plane is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:bar_arrangement_in_a_plane}. With this
configuration there is no dead area for particles crossing a plane with angles less than 45 degrees from the beam axis.

\begin{figure}[htp!]

 \caption[EMR bar cross-section and plane arrangement]{EMR bar cross-section and bars arrangement in a plane. There are 59 bars per plane.}
 \label{fig:bar_arrangement_in_a_plane}
\end{figure}


The light, produced when a particle crosses a bar, is collected by a wave-length shifting (WLS) fiber glued inside the bar. 
Transparent epoxy\footnote{Prochima E30 water effect resin} is used to glue the WLS fiber in order to increase the light
collection efficiency. At both ends of a bar the WLS fiber is coupled to a clear fiber that transfers the light to a photo-multiplier
(PMT). The clear fibers are protected with rubber sleeves and packed in aluminum fiber boxes as drawn in Figure 
\ref{fig:clear_fiber_package}. In order to reduce the bending radius, which affects light attenuation, each fiber has individual
length. The two bunches of clear fibers coming from the two sides of a plane are glued into different types of connectors.
One is designed to match a multi-anode PMT, when the other one matches a single-anode PMT.

\begin{figure}[ht]

 bending radius. The bending radius of some of the fibers is indicate in red. The calibration fiber is also shown. }

 \caption[CAD drawing of the EMR detector]{CAD drawing of the complete EMR detector. The external protective panels are not shown.}
 \label{fig:emr_full_cad_model}
\end{figure}

Two planes attached to each other via aluminum profiles form a rigid structure called module (Figure~\ref{fig:emr_module}). 
The full detector contains 24 modules as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:emr_full_cad_model}. Panels cover all sides of the detector
in order to insure a light-tightness. The signal coming from each multi-anode PMT is read-out and processed by a front-end board
attached directly to the fiber box as shown in Figure \ref{fig:emr_module}. The single anode PMTs is equipped whit a
voltage divider and the analog signal is sent outside the detector for digitization.

A calibration system was installed inside the enclosure of the detector in order to monitor the drift of the gain and the quantum
efficiency of the PMTs. This system is made of a LED driver distributing light homogeneously to 100 fiber. Each fiber box is
connected to one of the calibration fibers through a dedicated connector. Inside a fiber box a clear fiber connects the calibration
fiber to the PMT (see Figure \ref{fig:clear_fiber_package}).

All cables inside the detector are feed through four patch-panels. There are 96 high-voltage, 6 low voltage, 48 analog, 48 digital,
and one configuration cables in total. A support frame is designed to withhold the full weight of the sensitive volume with electronics
($\sim$ 1 tonne). In order to protect the front-end electronics from the magnetic field of the spectrometer solenoid, situated nearby
the detector, a shielding plate is mounted on the side of the detector that faces the beam. The total weight of the detector is almost
2.5 tonnes.

\subsection{Optical Elements}
The scintillator bars were manufactured at extrusion facility at Fermilab~\cite{PlaDalmau:2001fr}.
This facility also produced scintillators of different shapes for other experiments like: DO preshower detector, MINOS~\cite{PlaDalmau:2001en},
Minerva~\cite{PlaDalmau:2005df}, SciBar (K2K/SciBoone), Star, Mayn Pyramid Mapping, Hall-B JLAB, T2K-ND280, Double-Chooz, Amiga - Piere Auger.
Each bars is 110~cm long, 1.7~cm high and
3.3~cm wide with 3~mm hole along the bar for a wavelength shifting fiber. The scintillator is made of polystyrene
pellets\footnote{Dow Styron 663 W} as base, 1\% PPO\footnote{scintillator, 2,5-diphenyloxazole, C$_{15}$H$_{11}$NO} as primary and 0.03\% 
POPOP\footnote{wavelength shifter, 1,4-di-(5-phenyl-2-oxazolyl)-benzene, C$_{24}$H$_{16}$N$_{2}$O, spectrum peaks at 410 nm (violet)} 
as secondary fluor. Each bar is coated with TiO$_2$ reflector to increase light collection by a wavelength shifting fiber inserted inside
the scintillator. Light output of the scintillator was measured~\cite{PlaDalmau:2001fr} with a photo-multiplier (25\% quantum efficiency)
and it is around 17 photo-electrons. 

The WLS fiber glued inside the bar is a double cladding 1.2~mm in diameter fiber, produced by Saint-Gobain Crystals~\cite{saintgobain}.
The core material of the fiber is polystyrene with acrylic cladding. It has very large numerical aperture of 0.58 compared to 0.2-0.3
of graded-index multimode fiber used in data communications. Trapping efficiency is 3.5\%. The light is absorbed in blue part of a visible
spectrum and re-emitted in green. 

The clear fiber, used to transfer light from the ends of scintillator bar to the PMTs, is a 1.5mm multi-cladding fiber produced by 
Kuraray~\cite{kuraray} with special structure (S-type) that allows for better rigidity against bending. The aperture of this fiber matches
to the one of WLS fiber so that insertion loss is minimal.

A special connector was designed to couple a clear fiber to a wavelength shifting fiber (see Figure~\ref{fig:fiber_connectors_cad}).
It has a small cylindrical enlargement which is meant to be filled with glue to fix the fiber in the connector. Thanks to that configuration
it is possible to avoid crimping the fiber since a sharp edge of the connector would easily damage it. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:fiber_connectors_cad}
the retaining clip (B) is screwed into the wavelength shifting fiber connector (A) so that clear fiber connector can be easily and safely
attached. All these peaces are non-standard and could not be found on a market, therefore a special mold was designed to produce them using
injection molding technique.

\end{figure}

Both faces of the bar's fiber connectors are polished with a special polishing machine. Four different grades of sand paper are used to achieve
a mirror like quality of the polished surfaces. The last step is performed using a 1$\mu$m grade
diamond-based polishing paper. The same procedure is applied to the clear fiber connectors and PMT connectors (see Figure~\ref{fig:pmt_connectors}).

\subsection{Photodetectors}
As it was briefly mentioned earlier the EMR has a dual readout. Each scintillator plane is equipped with a multi-anode PMT, which collects
the light from the individual bars and a single-anode PMT which detects the integrated response of all bars in the plane. 
\begin{figure}[h]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./mapmt}

 \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{./mapmt_vertical_shift}
 \caption[Distribution of Multi-Anode PMT dimensions]{Distribution of Multi-Anode PMT dimensions.}
 \label{fig:mapmt_dimensions}
\end{figure}

The multi-anode photo-multiplier tube (MAPMT) is a 64-channel PMT produced by Hamamatsu (model R5900-00-M64~\cite{hamamatsu_mapmt}, see
Figure~\ref{fig:mapmt}, left). The spectral sensitivity matches to the emission spectrum of the wavelength shifting fiber. It is 
placed in a $\mu$-metal tube  which serves as additional shielding against the static magnetic filed. Inside $\mu$-metal tube, the PMT
is aligned with respect to the fiber connector in such a way that each fiber shines only one
channel. Therefor it was important to measure all dimensions of the PMT and especially position of the anode matrix with respect to the
PMT case (Figure~\ref{fig:mapmt}, centre). Figure~\ref{fig:mapmt_dimensions} shows distributions of the measured dimensions (width and
height) and displacements of the anode matrix for 53 MAPMTs. It was found that on average the matrix is shifted by 0.5~mm upwards (see
Figure~\ref{fig:mapmt}, right and Figure~\ref{fig:mapmt_dimensions}, bottom right). This was taken into account in the design of the
MAPMT fiber connectors.

As for the MAPMTs, the single-anode photo-multiplier tube (SAPMT) is placed in a $\mu$-metal tube. The EMR detector was initially assembled
by reusing old SAPMTs, available after the disassembly of the HARP experiment \cite{harp}. These were 10 stage linear focused PMTs produced
by Philips (model XP2972). A special selection procedure was developed in order to select the best samples for the assembly of the detector
\cite{philips}. In 2014, during the upgrade of the detector, all Philips SAPMT were replaced by new SAPMTs produced by Hamamatsu (model R6427
\cite{hamamatsu_mapmt}).

\subsection{Electronics Layout}
In MICE the spill is defined as the period when the target crosses the ISIS proton beam. The maximum spill repeating rate allowed by the
MICE target system is $\sim 0.75 \ Hz$. The overall principle of the MICE Data Acquisition (DAQ) system is that during the spill the accumulated
digital data is kept in local memory buffers and the readout is performed only at the end of the spill.

\begin{figure}[htp!]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./EMR_electronics_layout}
 \caption[EMR electronics layout.]{EMR electronics layout. {\bf FEB:} front-end board for multi-anode PMT readout. {\bf DBB:} digitizer-buffer
 board. {\bf MAROC~3:} 64 channel readout ASIC for multi-anode PMT. {\bf MAPMT:} multi-anode PMT. {\bf SAPMT:} single-anode PMT.}
 \label{fig:EMR_electronics_layout}
\end{figure}

A schematic layout of the EMR electronics is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:EMR_electronics_layout}. The multi-anode PMT connected via a flex cable
to a front-end board (FEB) which processes the signal and sends it to a piggy-back digitizer-buffer board (DBB) for digitization and storage.
The FEB is configured by the VME configuration board (VCB), which resides in the VME crate in the control rack. This board is able to configure
up to 16 FEBs, therefore three of them are required for the full detector. The DBBs are readout by groups of six. In each group the first DBB
is a master and other five are slaves. All six boards are daisy-chained via ethernet cable and the master is connected to a VME readout board
(VRB), which transfers all the data from the six DBBs to the DAQ computer. In the whole detector there are 8 groups of DBBs, i.e. 8 VRBs are
installed in the control rack. 

\subsubsection{Front-End and Digitizer-Buffer Boards}
\begin{figure}[htp!]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{./feb_dbb}
 \caption[Front-end and buffer board assembly]{Front-end and Digitizer-Buffer board assembly.}
 \label{fig:feb_dbb}
\end{figure}

The multi-anode PMT is readout by a dedicated front-end board equipped with piggy-back digitizer-buffer board which stores hit information during
a spill. Figure~\ref{fig:feb_dbb} show the full assembly that is mounted on every plane of the detector. It consists of a PMT attached to a voltage
divider which is connected to a FEB through a flex cable. This cable also creates additional pressure between the PMT and fiber connector. The FEB
is able to process all 64\footnote{Each EMR plane contains 59 scintillator bars which results in having 5 redundant channels.} signals of the MAPMT
thanks to 64-channel ASIC\footnote{Application-Specific Integrated Circuit} called MAROC\footnote{Multi Anode ReadOut Chip}. The 64 analog signals
are feed into the MAROC chip where they are shaped and discriminated. The discriminated signals are then forwarded to two high density connectors
where a DBB is connected. The width of the discriminated signal represents a time over threshold measurement. The MAROC ASIC also provides analog
measurement - signal charge. This measurement is based on a slow shaper and is multiplexed from all the channels and it requires a trigger (either
external or internal) to produce a measurement. It takes tens of microseconds (depending on MAROC configuration) to process all the multiplexed
signals and this dead time is not acceptable for the MICE DAQ duty cycle (a few hundred triggers per 1~ms spill). Therefore only time-over-threshold
measurement is used since it is practically dead-timeless. The function of the FPGA chip\footnote{Altera Cyclone II (EP2C35F484C8N)} is mainly to
forward data from MAROC to the DBB and to send configuration signals from the VCB to the MAROC and verify their status. The board has separate power
for analog and digital part (both 5~V). The total power consumption of the board is 0.6~Amp.


The two essential roles of the DBB are to sample the 63 channels (and external trigger) coming from the FEB and to transmit the event data upon request
of the acquisition system. The digitization starts when the board receives the Spill Gate signal from an external LEMO connector. The number of clock
ticks from the begging of the spill to the leading edge and trailing edge of every discriminated signal coming from the FEB is recorded. The difference
between the two measurements represents the time over threshold of the original signal. The clock sampling rate is 400 MHz ($2.5 \ ns$ resolution). An
external trigger is also recorded by the DBB. The trigger signal is feed into one of the 64 input channel and is treated as any other signal. Therefore,
only 63 channels are recorded from the FEB. The board also calculates the width of every spill, counts the number of spills, number of triggers in the
spills, and number of hits in every channel.

The general architecture of the DBB is organized around a single FPGA\footnote{Altera Stratix II (EP2S30F484C3N)} that performs the sampling, data
buffering, and dataflow control functions of the board. Internal memory of the FPGA, configured as FIFO, is used to store the event data which is
a collection of leading and trailing edge timestamps that occurred on each channel during a specific spill. Two gigabit transceivers\footnote{TLK1501}
are interfaced to the FPGA to provide the physical transmission channels and form an upstream command link and a downstream data link. Six DBB's are
grouped together and daisy-chained with upstream and downstream links via ethernet cable. The first DBB in each group is directly connected to the
acquisition system - the VRB - via four coaxial cables.

\subsubsection{VME Configuration Board}
The VCB is a single FPGA\footnote{Altera Cyclone II (EP2C50F484C8N} board designed to perform configuration of the MAROC chip on the FEB. The
communication between the boards is realized via LVDS\footnote{Low-Voltage Differential Signaling, communication protocol.} signals driven and received
by LVDS drivers/receivers directly connected to corresponding FPGA's. As mentioned in the previous section, it can read analog signal (charge of the signal
from every channel) from the FEB but this is not implemented in the current design. The board is connected to VME bus through which it communicates with
the VME controller and the DAQ computer. The MAROC chip is configured by TTL\footnote{Transistor-Transistor Logic} signal composed of 830 bits which code
the configuration parameters.


\subsubsection{VME Read-Out Board}\label{electronics:subsec:vme_readout_board}

One VRB performs the readout of a group of six DBBs. It is a single FPGA\footnote{Altera Cyclone II (EP2C50F484C8N)} board with a gigabit 
transceiver\footnote{TLK1501}, which drives the communication with the DBBs and four high-speed 16M-bit static RAMs\footnote{IS61WV102416BLL-10TLI - SRAM,
16Mbit, 10ns, 48TSOP}, providing a local memory buffer. During the readout cycle, the transfer of the data between the DBBs and the DAQ computer is executed
in two steps. First, after a request from the DAQ computer, the VRB starts transferring data from the 6 DBBs. The gigabit transceiver is used for this and
the received data is temporarily stored locally. The four static RAMs, each organized as 16 bits data words, are grouped in two pairs, providing the record of the
DBB data, which is originally structured in 32 bits data words. Once the first part of the transfer is completed, and all the data accumulated by the 6 DBBs
during the spill is available in the local memory buffer of the VRB, the DAQ computer sends a second request which triggers the transfer of this data over
the VME bus.

Additional LVDS input/output connector is available at the front pannel of the board. This connector does not have a specific function, and was used mostly
for debugging.

\subsubsection{Fast ADC Board}\label{electronics:subsec:fast_adc_board}

The Flash ADC Waveform Digitizer made by CAEN~\cite{V1731} is used to readout signals from single-anode PMTs. The ADC has a sampling frequency of 500 M
samples per second (2~ns resolution timing resolution). A pulse shape of each input signal is digitized by 8 bit ADC and continuously written in a circular
memory buffer. When a trigger arrives the FPGA writes certain number samples defined by the pre- and post-trigger settings into a buffer which then is
available for readout via VME bus.


\subsection{Mechanics}\label{design:subsec:mechanics}

Total wight of the sensitive volume of the detector is almost 1 tonne. During construction and installation it is required to rotate and move the detector;
besides that it is meant to be transported in a truck over more then 1000 kilometers. Therefore a reinforced support frame (see Figure~\ref{fig:emr_support})
was design so that it can withhold the weight of the sensitive detector and all the stress that may happen during the transportation and installation. In its
final position the EMR is installed in such a way so that planes are located vertically perpendicular to a beam direction. 

\begin{figure}[htp!]

\begin{figure}[htp!]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{./internal_dimensions}
 \caption[EMR dimensions]{EMR dimensions (mm).}
 \label{fig:internal_dimensions}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:internal_dimensions} shows location of the sensitive volume with respect to the support frame. The frame is covered with panels so that the
whole volume is light-tight. A panel which faces the beam (see Figure~\ref{fig:internal_dimensions}, right) is made of 5~cm thick iron plates (total wight
755~kg) and plays a role of global shielding for electronics. The back panel is made of metal profiles and thin aluminum panels. The opening in the shielding
front panel is closed with a thin wooden end cap and in the back panel - with metal end cap (since it holds the weight of the detector during assembly when
it is in horizontal position).
